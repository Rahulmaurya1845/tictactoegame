<!-- A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (< >). Tags are used to create HTML elements. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the start of an element, while the closing tag indicates the end. The closing tag is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (/). -->
 <!-- in given code <br> <p></p>,<h1></h1> all are tags-->
